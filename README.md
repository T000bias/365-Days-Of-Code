# Learning Python in Public
(Starting on January 1st)
Learning Python in public for 6 Months

Starting in January, I am challenging myself to learn Python (and any related topics) to become a job ready data engineer. For the first month I will be learning the basics of Python before moving onto more advanced topics and frameworks (if frameworks are not in the first month). Any resource that I use in this journey will be in the resource section and I will highlight the section(s) that were used that day; I will also disclose if those resources are free or paid

Inspired by ["Learning Clojure in Public"](https://github.com/alaq/learning-clojure-in-public)
