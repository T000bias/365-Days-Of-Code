# Learning Python in Public

Learning Python in public for 4 Months

Starting today, I am challenging myself to learn Python (and any related topics) to become a job ready data engineer. For the first month I will be learning the basics of Python before moving onto more advanced topics and frameworks (if frameworks are not in the first month). Any resource that I use in this journey will be in the resource section and I will highlight the section(s) that were used that day; I will also disclose if those resources are free or paid
